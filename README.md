## My Approach

I started by following the tutorial and making a replica of the tutorial project. It was easy to follow and included how to use sounds in the HTML, which I haven't encountered in my previous projects. I am used to TDDing all my projects so I immediately set about setting up Jasmine, a testing framework I have used before with JavaScript. After setting up the testing I realised that actually the project is all front end so this sort of testing isn't necessary.
